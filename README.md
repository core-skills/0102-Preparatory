## Pre-session Reading & Resources

Throughout the course we will attempt to stick some interesting links in this document for you to follow up on at your own leisure. These are not compulsory (we realise everyone is busy!) but if you've got some downtime on the train they might be interesting to look at.

The links below are for some additional (broader) info, the presentations and notebooks presented in the workshop include detailed info on version control and using Python and Jupyter notebooks for data exploration.

- Version control and working in teams using Git, [Github](https://help.github.com/), [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) (or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client))
- Using Anaconda for package management ([cheatsheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)) and [setting up environments](https://medium.com/datareply/working-with-python-environments-anaconda-package-manager-and-ides-663e771b6ed8)
