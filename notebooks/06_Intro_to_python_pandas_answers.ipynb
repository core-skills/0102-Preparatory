    "# Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in this lesson: numeric and character types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A **floating point** (known as a\n",
    "float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For\n",
    "example: 1.13, 2.0 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and\n",
    "floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data\n",
    "type so the decimal points are not lost. In a vector or data fram (we learn about these different types later) the entire object or an entire column will be of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus 1.13 would be stored as 1.\n",
    "1234.345 is stored as 1234. You will often see the data type `Int64` in python\n",
    "which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to\n",
    "store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can\n",
    "store in each \"cell\". Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to\n",
    "optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Character Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are values that contain numbers and / or characters. \n",
    "For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. \n",
    "A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234' could be stored as a\n",
    "string. As could '10.23'. However **strings that contain numbers can not be used\n",
    "for mathematical operations**!\n",

    "## About Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",
    "tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment\n",
    "out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.\n",
    "Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An\n",
    "example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to load a library once during your session. You can load the library when needed\n",
    "or you can load all necessary libraries at the beginning of your script. \n",
    "This is good practice, especially for the readability of your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy **Pandas cheathsheet** can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax\n",
    "`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the\n",
    "function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we\n",
    "have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each\n",
    "time we call a Pandas function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So What's a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional (labeled) data structure that stores data of different\n",
    "types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more) in columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in R. \n",
