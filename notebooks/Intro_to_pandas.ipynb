    "## About Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",
    "tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment\n",
    "out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.\n",
    "Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An\n",
    "example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to load a library once during your session. You can load the library when needed\n",
    "or you can load all necessary libraries at the beginning of your script. \n",
    "This is good practice, especially for the readability of your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy **Pandas cheathsheet** can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax\n",
    "`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the\n",
    "function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we\n",
    "have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each\n",
    "time we call a Pandas function."
